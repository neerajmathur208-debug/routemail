# RoutEmail - Email Rotation SaaS Platform

## Original Problem Statement
Build a simple SaaS web application for small businesses to automatically send emails in rotation across multiple connected email accounts with daily sending limits.

## Core Requirements
1. **Email Account Management**: Connect multiple email accounts (SMTP/IMAP or OAuth)
2. **List Management**: Upload and manage CSV email lists with multiple lists per user
3. **Campaign Management**: Create campaigns with rich text editor, dynamic variables ({column_name}), save/load campaigns with statuses (Draft, Scheduled, Running, Paused, Completed)
4. **Scheduler**: Schedule campaigns to send at a specific date/time or send immediately
5. **Rotational Sending**: Send emails rotationally across accounts with custom daily limits
6. **Sending Logs**: Detailed logs showing sent/failed status and error messages
7. **Admin Panel**: Platform-wide monitoring for super_admin users
8. **Subscription System**: Stripe-integrated yearly subscriptions with plan limits enforcement

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI, Recharts, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: 
  - Emergent-managed Google Social Login
  - Email + Password (bcrypt hashed)
- **Payments**: Stripe (live keys configured)
- **Live Chat**: Tawk.to (authenticated pages only)

## Database Schema
- **users**: email, name, google_id, password_hash, provider ('google'/'email'), is_active, created_at, role ('user' | 'super_admin'), plan_type ('free'/'starter'/'growth'), subscription_status, stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id, trial_ends_at, billing_cycle_start, billing_cycle_end, grace_period_end, monthly_unique_recipient_count, last_recipient_reset_date
- **user_sessions**: user_id, session_token, expires_at
- **email_accounts**: user_id, email, type, credentials (encrypted), daily_limit, daily_sent_count, status
- **email_lists**: user_id, list_name, original_filename, column_headers, total_rows
- **email_list_contacts**: list_id, contact_data, email, status
- **campaigns**: user_id, name, subject, body, status, email_list_id, total_emails, sent_count, scheduled_at
- **email_queue**: campaign_id, recipient_email, status, error_message, sent_at

## Critical Notes
- Super admin email: dhruvmathur208@gmail.com
- Do NOT use react-quill (crashes) - use custom RichTextEditor.jsx
- Database is MongoDB only
- SMTP passwords are Fernet encrypted
- User passwords are bcrypt hashed
- Email sending is implemented but not connected to live SMTP for testing
- Stripe integration uses LIVE keys - subscriptions are real
- Tawk.to widget only loads on authenticated routes
- Google OAuth uses Emergent Auth (https://auth.emergentagent.com) - NOT a custom backend endpoint
- Plan limits are enforced server-side (accounts, contacts, monthly recipients)
- Logo height: Landing page navbar ~100px, Login/Register 80px, Sidebar 64px
